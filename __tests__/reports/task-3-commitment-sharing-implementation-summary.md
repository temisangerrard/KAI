## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 2.1 ✅

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User completes prediction commitment
2. Success state triggers with `commitmentSuccess = true`
3. ShareButton component receives commitment data:
   - `prediction`: Contains user ID, market ID, option ID, tokens staked
   - `market`: Contains market details and metadata
   - `optionText`: Human-readable option text (e.g., "Yes", "No")
4. ShareModal generates appropriate share text and URLs
5. Social platform sharing or clipboard copy functionality

### Code Quality
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Proper error handling for clipboard operations
- Responsive design considerations
- Accessibility features maintained
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

## Files Modified
1. `app/components/share-button.tsx` - Enhanced for commitment sharing
2. `app/components/share-modal.tsx` - Added commitment sharing logic
3. `app/components/prediction-commitment.tsx` - Integrated share button in success flow

## Files Created
1. `__tests__/components/commitment-sharing.test.tsx`
