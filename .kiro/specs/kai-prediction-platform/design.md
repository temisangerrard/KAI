# KAI Prediction Platform Design Document

## Overview

KAI is a prediction platform specifically designed for women, reimagining the traditional prediction market experience to feel more like engaging with reality TV and social media. The platform allows users to purchase tokens and use them to participate in or create prediction markets around trending topics, cultural events, and social phenomena. By focusing on social engagement, shareable content, and an intuitive user experience, KAI aims to attract women who enjoy reality TV and pop culture but may be put off by traditional gambling platforms.

This design document outlines the architecture, components, data models, and implementation strategy for the KAI prediction platform, based on the requirements document.

## Architecture

KAI will be built as a Next.js application with a client-side focus, leveraging React for the UI components and state management. The application will follow a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

- 70%+ coverage for UI components
- 90%+ coverage for critical user flows (token purchase, prediction)

## User Experience Design

### Design Principles

1. **Non-Gambling Focus**
   - Use language focused on "predictions" and "opinions" rather than "bets"
   - Frame outcomes as "insights" rather than "wins/losses"
   - Design visual elements that feel social and entertainment-focused

2. **Social Engagement**
   - Prioritize social interactions and community features
   - Make sharing and commenting prominent
   - Highlight user participation and community trends

3. **Visual Appeal**
   - Use a color palette appealing to the target demographic
   - Incorporate engaging animations and visual feedback
   - Create a modern, clean interface that feels premium
