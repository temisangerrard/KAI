# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Wallet Wagmi Token Enhancement adds missing functionality to KAI's existing CDP wallet implementation by implementing CDP's EVM Token Balance API for comprehensive token discovery across multiple networks. This enhancement will provide users with automatic detection of all their tokens beyond the current hardcoded list, support for multiple networks, and better token management while preserving all existing CDP functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Token Balance Discovery via CDP API

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to automatically see all tokens in my wallet without manually adding them, so that I can discover and manage all my assets including tokens I may have forgotten about.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch all token balances using CDP's `/v2/evm/token-balances/{network}/{address}` API endpoint
2. WHEN token balances are retrieved THEN the system SHALL display all tokens with non-zero balances including proper token metadata
3. WHEN the API returns token data THEN each token SHALL show symbol, name, balance amount, decimals, and contract address
4. WHEN displaying tokens THEN the system SHALL replace the current hardcoded token list with API-discovered tokens
5. WHEN token metadata is missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle missing fields and show contract address as fallback
6. WHEN the API returns paginated results THEN the system SHALL fetch all pages using the `nextPageToken` to show complete token list

### Requirement 2: CDP API Authentication and Integration

**User Story:** As a developer integrating CDP's REST API, I want proper authentication and error handling for the token balance API, so that the system can reliably fetch token data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls to CDP THEN the system SHALL use proper Bearer token authentication with JWT signed using CDP API Key Secret
2. WHEN the API returns errors THEN the system SHALL handle rate limits, timeouts, and service unavailable responses gracefully
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and fallback to the existing manual token balance method
4. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show cached data if available or fallback to existing functionality
5. WHEN API responses are successful THEN the system SHALL parse the token balance data according to CDP's schema
6. WHEN making multiple API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting to avoid exceeding API limits

### Requirement 3: Cross-Network Token Balance Aggregation

**User Story:** As a user with assets across multiple networks, I want to see all my tokens from Base, Base Sepolia, and Ethereum networks in one unified view, so that I can see my complete portfolio without having to switch between networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet loads THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch token balances from all supported networks ("base", "base-sepolia", "ethereum")
2. WHEN displaying tokens THEN each token SHALL show which network it belongs to alongside the token information
3. WHEN tokens are found on multiple networks THEN they SHALL be grouped by network or clearly labeled with network indicators
4. WHEN a network API call fails THEN the system SHALL continue to show tokens from other networks and indicate which network failed
5. WHEN all networks have been queried THEN the system SHALL display a unified view of all discovered tokens across all networks
6. WHEN refreshing balances THEN the system SHALL refresh tokens from all networks simultaneously

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Token Display and Management

**User Story:** As a user viewing my token portfolio, I want to see comprehensive information about all my discovered tokens and be able to use them in transactions, so that I can manage my complete token portfolio effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying API-discovered tokens THEN each token SHALL show the token symbol, name, formatted balance, and contract address
2. WHEN a user wants to send tokens THEN the send form SHALL populate with all discovered tokens in the asset dropdown
3. WHEN sending a discovered token THEN the system SHALL use the correct contract address and decimals from the API data
4. WHEN tokens are loading from the API THEN the user SHALL see loading states that don't interfere with existing ETH balance display
5. WHEN API-discovered tokens are available THEN they SHALL be combined with the existing ETH balance in a unified display
6. WHEN a user refreshes balances THEN both the existing manual balance fetch and new API call SHALL be triggered

### Requirement 5: Graceful Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user relying on token balance information, I want the system to handle API failures gracefully without breaking existing functionality, so that I can always access my wallet even when external services are down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

WHEN the CDP token balance API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to show ETH balance and existing token functionality without API dependency
2. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and fall back to existing manual token balance checking
3. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and show cached data if available
4. WHEN network requests timeout THEN the system SHALL show a timeout message and allow manual retry
5. WHEN API returns invalid data THEN the system SHALL validate responses and ignore malformed token data
6. WHEN displaying API errors THEN the user SHALL see a clear message that doesn't interfere with existing wallet functionality

### Requirement 6: Efficient Cross-Network API Usage and Caching

**User Story:** As a user accessing my wallet frequently, I want efficient token balance loading across all networks that doesn't make unnecessary API calls, so that the wallet loads quickly and doesn't hit rate limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token balances are fetched THEN the system SHALL cache API results per network for 60 seconds to avoid redundant calls
2. WHEN the user manually refreshes THEN the system SHALL bypass cache and fetch fresh data from all networks
3. WHEN handling paginated API responses THEN the system SHALL efficiently fetch all pages for each network and combine results
4. WHEN fetching from multiple networks THEN the system SHALL make parallel API calls to all networks for faster loading
5. WHEN the wallet component unmounts THEN any pending API requests for all networks SHALL be cancelled to avoid memory leaks
6. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN subsequent calls for the same network data SHALL be deduplicated
