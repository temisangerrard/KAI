# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Coinbase CDP Integration replaces KAI's Firebase Authentication with Coinbase's embedded smart wallets while maintaining Firestore for data storage. This provides users with gasless Web3 transactions and seamless wallet functionality while preserving all existing platform features. Users will authenticate via email to create smart wallet accounts, with wallet addresses serving as their primary user identifiers in the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Wallet Account Creation

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign up with my email address and automatically receive a smart wallet account, so that I can access KAI's prediction markets with Web3 capabilities and gasless transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the signup page and enters "user@example.com" THEN the system SHALL create a Coinbase smart wallet account using CDP
2. WHEN the smart wallet is created THEN the system SHALL store the user's profile in Firestore using the wallet address as the document ID
3. WHEN account creation completes THEN the user SHALL see their wallet address displayed and be able to access the markets page
4. WHEN a user enters an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display "Please enter a valid email address" error message
5. WHEN smart wallet creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow the user to retry
6. WHEN the account is successfully created THEN the user SHALL have gasless transaction capabilities enabled

### Requirement 2: Email-Based Authentication

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to sign in with my email address through the smart wallet system, so that I can access my existing KAI account and prediction history without needing passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a returning user enters their registered email THEN the CDP system SHALL authenticate them and provide access to their smart wallet
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL retrieve the user's profile data from Firestore using their wallet address
3. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN they SHALL be redirected to the markets page with full access to their account
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display "Authentication failed. Please try again." and allow retry
5. WHEN a user signs in successfully THEN their wallet connection status SHALL be maintained across page navigation
6. WHEN a user signs out THEN both their CDP session and local app session SHALL be terminated

### Requirement 3: Firestore Data Migration

**User Story:** As an existing KAI user, I want my account data to be preserved when the platform migrates to smart wallets, so that I don't lose my prediction history, tokens, or profile information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration process runs THEN existing user documents SHALL be moved from Firebase UID keys to wallet address keys
2. WHEN a user's data is migrated THEN their tokens, predictions, and profile information SHALL remain intact and accessible
3. WHEN migration completes THEN all existing users SHALL be able to sign in using their email addresses through the new CDP system
4. WHEN the system queries user data THEN it SHALL use wallet addresses instead of Firebase UIDs as document identifiers
5. WHEN migration fails for any user THEN the system SHALL log the error and maintain a rollback capability
6. WHEN all users are migrated THEN the old Firebase Auth dependencies SHALL be safely removable

### Requirement 4: Smart Wallet Interface

**User Story:** As a user with a smart wallet account, I want to view and manage my wallet through a dedicated wallet page, so that I can see my balance, transaction history, and perform Web3 operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the wallet page THEN they SHALL see their smart wallet address, current balance, and transaction history
2. WHEN a user wants to copy their wallet address THEN they SHALL be able to click a copy button and receive confirmation
3. WHEN the wallet page loads THEN it SHALL display "Smart Account" and "Gasless Transactions Enabled" indicators
4. WHEN a user has zero balance THEN they SHALL see options to fund their wallet through supported methods
5. WHEN viewing transaction history THEN users SHALL see timestamps, amounts, and transaction types for all wallet activity
6. WHEN the wallet page is accessed on mobile THEN all wallet functions SHALL be touch-friendly and responsive

### Requirement 5: Authentication Context Integration

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the KAI platform, I want the authentication system to seamlessly integrate with existing components, so that all current features continue to work without breaking changes to the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component uses the auth context THEN it SHALL receive user data with wallet address as the primary identifier
2. WHEN API routes need to verify authentication THEN they SHALL validate CDP authentication tokens instead of Firebase tokens
3. WHEN the app initializes THEN the CDP provider SHALL be available to all components throughout the application
4. WHEN a user's authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL update accordingly using the existing auth context pattern
5. WHEN database queries are made THEN they SHALL use wallet addresses to fetch user-specific data from Firestore
6. WHEN the system needs to identify a user THEN it SHALL use the wallet address consistently across all operations

### Requirement 6: Navigation and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user of the KAI platform, I want the wallet functionality to be easily accessible through the existing navigation, so that I can manage my smart wallet alongside my prediction market activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the bottom navigation THEN they SHALL see a "Wallet" option that navigates to the smart wallet page
2. WHEN a user accesses the hamburger menu THEN they SHALL see wallet-related options and quick access to wallet functions
3. WHEN a user is on the wallet page THEN the navigation SHALL highlight the wallet section as active
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN they SHALL be redirected to the login page and all wallet state SHALL be cleared
5. WHEN contextual help is accessed from the wallet page THEN it SHALL provide relevant information about smart wallet features
6. WHEN the app is used on mobile devices THEN all wallet navigation elements SHALL meet accessibility standards and touch target requirements
