# Implementation Plan

## Web3 Branch Strategy
For this Web3 branch, we're simplifying authentication by using Base Account as the single source of truth. Every user gets a smart wallet, whether they sign up with email or connect an existing wallet. Email users get automatic smart wallet creation with email-based recovery.

**User Flow:**
- **Existing Wallet Users**: Connect wallet → Sign with Base Account
- **Email Users**: Enter email → Auto-create Base smart wallet → Email becomes recovery method
- **All Users**: Get gasless transactions, USDC payments, and seamless Web3 UX
