# Implementation Plan

## Current Status
**Previous implementation was incomplete** - only basic timeline UI was added. The core resolution infrastructure (database schema, services, APIs, admin interface) was not implemented despite being mentioned in the PR.

## Fee Structure (Updated)
- **House Fee**: 5% (goes to platform)
- **Creator Fee**: 1-5% (configurable per market, goes to market creator)
- **Winner Pool**: 90-94% (distributed proportionally among winners)

## Priority Tasks (Fix the Foundation)

- [x] **CRITICAL: Fix Database Schema** 
  - The PR claimed to add `pendingResolution` and `resolution` fields but they don't exist
  - Must implement proper Market interface updates in `lib/types/database.ts`
  - Add resolution workflow state tracking

- [x] **CRITICAL: Implement Core Services**
  - Create `ResolutionService` for processing market resolutions
  - Implement payout calculation with house + creator fees
  - Add evidence validation and storage

- [x] **CRITICAL: Build Admin Interface**
  - Create the missing `admin-resolution-actions.tsx` component mentioned in PR
  - Implement resolution dashboard for pending markets
  - Add evidence collection and winner selection forms

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 14. Basic timeline integration (PARTIAL)
