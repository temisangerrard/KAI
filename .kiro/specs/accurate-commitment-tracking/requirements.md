# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI prediction platform needs a robust commitment tracking and payout distribution system that can accurately handle multiple user commitments across markets with unlimited options (not just yes/no). The system must track every individual commitment, support markets with 2-10+ options, handle users making multiple commitments to the same market across different options, and ensure accurate payout calculations and distributions when markets resolve.

**CRITICAL**: This system must maintain backward compatibility with existing dashboards and services while transforming the current binary yes/no commitment structure to support unlimited market options. All existing markets and commitments must continue to work during and after the migration.

## Current System Dependencies

### Existing Dashboards That Depend on Commitment Data:
1. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`) - Shows total commitments, active users, token metrics
2. **Admin Token Dashboard** (`/admin/tokens`) - Token circulation, user engagement, transaction analytics  
3. **Market Resolution Dashboard** (`/admin/resolution`) - Market statistics, participant counts, token totals
4. **Admin Markets Page** (`/admin/markets`) - Market statistics with real commitment data
5. **Market Detail Pages** - Individual market analytics and commitment breakdowns
6. **User Profile Pages** - User commitment history and statistics

### Critical Services That Must Continue Working:
1. **AdminCommitmentService** - Powers all admin analytics and market statistics
2. **TokenBalanceService** - User balance calculations and transaction processing
3. **PredictionCommitment Component** - User commitment interface (currently binary yes/no)
4. **Market Analytics** - Real-time market metrics and participation data
5. **Resolution Service** - Market resolution and payout distribution

### Current Data Structure (Must Be Preserved):
- **PredictionCommitment.position**: Currently `'yes' | 'no'` - must map to specific option IDs
- **Market.options**: Array of market options with individual statistics
- **AdminCommitmentService**: Expects current commitment structure for analytics
- **All dashboard queries**: Depend on current commitment aggregation patterns

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to make multiple commitments to different options within the same market, so that I can diversify my positions and maximize my prediction strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user commits tokens to a market option THEN the system SHALL create a unique PredictionCommitment record linking the user to the specific option ID
2. WHEN a user makes multiple commitments to the same market THEN the system SHALL track each commitment separately with individual records
3. WHEN a user commits to different options in the same market THEN the system SHALL accurately track which specific option each commitment targets
4. WHEN querying user commitments for a market THEN the system SHALL return all individual commitment records with exact option targeting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a market creator, I want to create markets with unlimited options (not just yes/no), so that I can create complex prediction scenarios with multiple possible outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a market THEN the system SHALL support 2 to 10+ options with unique identifiers
2. WHEN users commit to market options THEN the system SHALL link commitments to specific option IDs rather than binary yes/no positions
3. WHEN displaying market options THEN the system SHALL show accurate token totals and participant counts for each individual option
4. WHEN calculating market metrics THEN the system SHALL aggregate data across all options regardless of the number of options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to accurately track all user commitments and their positions, so that I can resolve markets and distribute payouts with complete precision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing market commitments THEN the system SHALL display every individual commitment with user ID, option ID, token amount, and timestamp
2. WHEN a user makes 30 commitments across multiple options THEN the system SHALL track all 30 commitments individually with exact option targeting
3. WHEN calculating market resolution THEN the system SHALL access all commitment records to determine winners and calculate accurate payouts
4. WHEN auditing market activity THEN the system SHALL provide complete commitment history with user attribution and option targeting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive accurate payouts when markets resolve, so that my winnings are calculated precisely based on my actual commitments and the market outcome.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a market resolves THEN the system SHALL identify all winning commitments based on the winning option ID
2. WHEN calculating payouts THEN the system SHALL use each individual commitment's token amount and odds to determine exact payout amounts
3. WHEN distributing payouts THEN the system SHALL update user balances accurately for each winning commitment
4. WHEN a user has multiple winning commitments THEN the system SHALL sum all individual payouts to determine total winnings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive commitment tracking that maintains data integrity, so that no commitments are lost and all payout calculations are verifiable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commitments are created THEN the system SHALL ensure each commitment has a unique ID and complete metadata
2. WHEN market resolution occurs THEN the system SHALL process all commitment records without data loss or corruption
3. WHEN payout calculations run THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails showing how each payout was calculated
4. WHEN commitment data is queried THEN the system SHALL return consistent results across multiple queries and time periods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin, I want detailed commitment analytics and reporting, so that I can verify market integrity and resolve disputes accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing market analytics THEN the system SHALL show total commitments, unique participants, and option-by-option breakdowns
2. WHEN investigating user activity THEN the system SHALL display all commitments made by a specific user across all markets
3. WHEN resolving market disputes THEN the system SHALL provide complete commitment history with timestamps and metadata
4. WHEN auditing payout distributions THEN the system SHALL show the calculation basis for each payout with commitment traceability

### Requirement 7 (CRITICAL - Backward Compatibility)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all existing dashboards and services to continue working during and after the commitment tracking upgrade, so that there is zero downtime and no data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new commitment system is deployed THEN all existing admin dashboards SHALL continue to display accurate data without modification
2. WHEN existing binary yes/no commitments are migrated THEN they SHALL be mapped to appropriate option IDs while preserving all original data
3. WHEN AdminCommitmentService queries are executed THEN they SHALL return data in the expected format for all existing dashboard components
4. WHEN new multi-option markets are created THEN they SHALL work seamlessly with existing dashboard analytics and display components
5. WHEN the PredictionCommitment component is updated THEN it SHALL support both binary markets (backward compatibility) and multi-option markets (new functionality)
6. WHEN market resolution occurs THEN both migrated binary commitments and new multi-option commitments SHALL be processed correctly for payout distribution

### Requirement 8 (CRITICAL - Data Migration)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all existing commitment data to be safely migrated to the new system, so that no historical data is lost and all analytics remain accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration process runs THEN all existing PredictionCommitment records SHALL be preserved with their original IDs and timestamps
2. WHEN binary position commitments are migrated THEN 'yes' positions SHALL map to the first option ID and 'no' positions SHALL map to the second option ID
3. WHEN migrated commitments are queried THEN they SHALL return the same analytics results as before migration
4. WHEN the migration completes THEN all dashboard statistics SHALL match pre-migration values exactly
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL be able to revert to the original binary structure without data loss
