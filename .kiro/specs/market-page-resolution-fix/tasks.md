# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Investigate current admin resolution page implementation
  - Locate the admin resolution page files (likely in `app/admin/resolution/` or similar)
  - Identify the main resolution page component and its data fetching logic
  - Document how the resolution page currently tries to fetch markets for resolution
  - Check if ResolutionService exists and what methods it has for fetching pending markets
  - Record any console errors specific to the resolution page data loading
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1_

- [x] 2. Analyze working admin market page patterns
  - Examine the working admin market page (likely `app/admin/markets/page.tsx`)
  - Document how the working page successfully fetches and displays market data
  - Identify the authentication patterns used in the working admin page
  - Extract the Firebase query patterns that work correctly
  - Document the component state management patterns that work
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Compare resolution page vs working page implementations
  - Create side-by-side comparison of data fetching approaches
  - Identify specific differences in authentication context handling
  - Document differences in Firebase query structure and execution
  - Identify missing or broken components in the resolution page data flow
  - Prioritize the most critical differences that prevent market loading
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Fix resolution page data fetching logic
  - Apply the working data fetching pattern from admin market page to resolution page
  - Ensure resolution page uses the same authentication context as working pages
  - Fix or implement the Firebase query to fetch markets needing resolution
  - Add proper error handling for data fetching failures
  - Test that markets appear on the resolution page after fixes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Implement proper market filtering for resolution
  - Add filtering logic to show only markets that need resolution (status: 'closed' or 'pending_resolution')
  - Filter markets that are past their end date but not yet resolved
  - Sort markets by priority (oldest first, highest stakes first)
  - Ensure filtered markets display correctly in the resolution interface
  - Test that only appropriate markets appear for resolution
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Fix authentication context for resolution page operations
  - Ensure resolution page has proper admin authentication context
  - Verify that Firebase operations on resolution page use correct authentication
  - Fix any authentication-related console errors on the resolution page
  - Test that admin operations work correctly on the resolution page
  - Verify that non-admin users cannot access resolution functionality
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Resolve Firebase internal assertion errors
  - Identify specific Firebase operations causing internal assertion error (ID: ca9)
  - Fix concurrent Firebase operations or transaction conflicts on resolution page
  - Add proper error handling for Firebase operation failures
  - Ensure proper cleanup of Firebase listeners on resolution page
  - Test that Firebase operations complete without internal assertion errors
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Clean up console errors affecting resolution page
  - Fix any remaining console errors that appear when loading the resolution page
  - Address TypeScript errors that may be preventing proper compilation
  - Fix React state management issues that generate console warnings
  - Ensure clean console output when using the resolution page
  - Test that resolution page operates without generating console errors
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 9. Test complete resolution page functionality
  - Verify that resolution page loads and displays markets needing resolution
  - Test that admin can view market details and resolution options
  - Confirm that resolution actions are accessible and functional
  - Test navigation to and from the resolution page works correctly
  - Verify that resolution page works consistently like other admin pages
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Validate fix stability and performance
  - Monitor resolution page for any recurring console errors
  - Verify that page load performance is acceptable
  - Test that fixes don't break other admin page functionality
  - Confirm that resolution page remains stable over multiple uses
  - Document the final working state for future reference
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
