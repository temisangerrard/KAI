# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI prediction platform's market resolution page is experiencing critical runtime errors that prevent proper functionality. Console errors show TypeScript property access issues in the TrendingService, Firebase authentication failures in AdminCommitmentService operations, and Firebase internal assertion errors (ID: ca9) that break the market resolution workflow. These errors need immediate resolution to restore market resolution page functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the market resolution page to load without console errors, so that I can access and manage market resolution functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the market resolution page THEN the system SHALL load without TypeScript property access errors
2. WHEN the TrendingService processes market data for resolution displays THEN the system SHALL use correct Market interface property names
3. WHEN market trending calculations execute on the resolution page THEN the system SHALL access `totalParticipants`, `totalTokensStaked`, `createdAt`, and `endsAt` properties correctly
4. WHEN the market resolution page renders THEN the system SHALL display market data without runtime errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TrendingService to use the correct Market interface properties, so that trending calculations work properly without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TrendingService accesses market participant data THEN the system SHALL use `totalParticipants` instead of `participants`
2. WHEN TrendingService accesses market token data THEN the system SHALL use `totalTokensStaked` instead of `totalTokens`
3. WHEN TrendingService accesses market date data THEN the system SHALL use `createdAt` and `endsAt` instead of `startDate` and `endDate`
4. WHEN trending score calculations execute THEN the system SHALL complete without property access errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want AdminCommitmentService operations to execute without Firebase authentication errors, so that market management functions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AdminCommitmentService performs Firebase operations THEN the system SHALL authenticate properly with the hybrid CDP authentication system
2. WHEN admin operations access Firestore collections THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication context
3. WHEN Firebase operations fail due to authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
4. WHEN admin functions execute THEN the system SHALL maintain proper user context throughout the operation chain

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want market resolution functionality to work without Firebase internal assertion errors, so that I can properly resolve markets and distribute payouts from the resolution page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market resolution operations execute THEN the system SHALL complete without Firebase internal assertion errors (ID: ca9)
2. WHEN resolution services access Firestore THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication and permission context
3. WHEN concurrent Firebase operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without internal state conflicts
4. WHEN market resolution completes THEN the system SHALL update all related data consistently without assertion failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all market resolution page console errors resolved systematically, so that the resolution workflow runs cleanly without runtime issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the market resolution page loads THEN the system SHALL display no console errors or warnings
2. WHEN navigating to and from the market resolution page THEN the system SHALL maintain error-free operation
3. WHEN market resolution data updates in real-time THEN the system SHALL process updates without generating console errors
4. WHEN all fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL provide a clean baseline for market resolution functionality
