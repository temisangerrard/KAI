# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up the KAI Prediction Platform codebase by identifying and removing unused code, components, and files. The goal is to maintain a clean, maintainable codebase that only contains actively used code before pushing to the main GitHub branch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused code and files from the repository, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all unused components, pages, and utility files
2. WHEN identifying unused files THEN the system SHALL verify that files are not imported or referenced anywhere in the codebase
3. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL ensure no breaking changes are introduced to the application
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all actively used functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify duplicate or redundant code, so that I can consolidate functionality and reduce code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for duplicates THEN the system SHALL identify similar components or utilities that serve the same purpose
2. WHEN finding redundant code THEN the system SHALL recommend consolidation strategies
3. WHEN consolidating code THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality
4. WHEN removing duplicates THEN the system SHALL update all import references accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused dependencies and imports, so that the bundle size is optimized and the project has minimal dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL identify unused import statements in all files
2. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify unused packages in package.json
3. WHEN removing unused imports THEN the system SHALL ensure the code still compiles and functions correctly
4. WHEN removing dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify no runtime errors are introduced

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize and structure the remaining code properly, so that the codebase follows consistent patterns and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL ensure all files follow the established project structure
2. WHEN structuring components THEN the system SHALL verify components are in appropriate directories
3. WHEN organizing utilities THEN the system SHALL consolidate related utilities in appropriate lib directories
4. WHEN restructuring THEN the system SHALL maintain all import paths and references correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that the cleaned codebase works correctly, so that I can confidently push to the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the application builds successfully
2. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL ensure all core features work as expected
3. WHEN validating imports THEN the system SHALL confirm no broken import references exist
4. WHEN checking types THEN the system SHALL ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
