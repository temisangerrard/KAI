# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI prediction platform is experiencing critical errors after the recent market resolution implementation, including a Firebase Firestore internal assertion error (ID: ca9). Rather than guessing at the root cause, we need to systematically run builds, identify all errors in both build and development environments, and fix them methodically to restore application stability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically capture and document all console errors in the development environment, so that I can methodically fix each runtime issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run dev` THEN the system SHALL capture and document all console errors and warnings
2. WHEN console errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (Firebase, React, TypeScript, etc.)
3. WHEN navigating the application THEN the system SHALL identify which specific pages or actions trigger each error
4. WHEN analyzing console output THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical errors that break functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the development environment and capture all runtime errors, so that I can identify issues that only appear during execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run dev` THEN the system SHALL capture all console errors, warnings, and Firebase issues
2. WHEN the development server starts THEN the system SHALL document any initialization errors
3. WHEN navigating through the application THEN the system SHALL identify which pages or components trigger errors
4. WHEN Firebase operations execute THEN the system SHALL capture specific Firestore errors and their context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to methodically fix each identified console error in order of priority, so that the application becomes stable without introducing new issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console errors are catalogued THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
2. WHEN fixing each error THEN the system SHALL address one issue at a time and verify the fix in the console
3. WHEN an error is resolved THEN the system SHALL re-test the specific functionality to ensure no new console errors appear
4. WHEN all critical console errors are fixed THEN the system SHALL verify full application functionality without console errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the market resolution functionality works correctly after all errors are fixed, so that the recent implementation is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all errors are resolved THEN the market resolution features SHALL function as intended
2. WHEN testing resolution workflows THEN the system SHALL complete operations without Firebase errors
3. WHEN users access resolution interfaces THEN the system SHALL load and operate normally
4. WHEN resolution data is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and proper state management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a clean, console-error-free baseline after fixes, so that future development can proceed without inherited runtime issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all fixes are complete THEN the development environment SHALL run without console errors or warnings
2. WHEN navigating through all application pages THEN the system SHALL operate without any console errors
3. WHEN all application features are tested THEN the system SHALL function normally without runtime errors
4. WHEN Firebase operations execute THEN the system SHALL maintain stable connections without internal assertion errors
