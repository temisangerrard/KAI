# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on enhancing the accessibility of the KAI prediction platform to ensure full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provide an inclusive experience for all users, including those with disabilities. The platform should be accessible via screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies while maintaining the engaging, social-media-like experience that defines KAI.

## Requirements

### 1. Screen Reader Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user who relies on screen readers, I want all content and functionality to be properly announced and navigable, so that I can fully participate in the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a screen reader user navigates the platform THEN the system SHALL provide proper semantic HTML structure with appropriate headings (h1-h6).
2. WHEN interactive elements are encountered THEN the system SHALL announce their purpose, state, and instructions through ARIA labels and descriptions.
3. WHEN dynamic content updates THEN the system SHALL use ARIA live regions to announce changes to screen reader users.
4. WHEN forms are presented THEN the system SHALL associate labels with form controls and provide clear error messages.
5. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful alternative text that describes the content and context.

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

**User Story:** As a user who cannot use a mouse, I want to navigate the entire platform using only keyboard controls, so that I can access all features independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates using Tab key THEN the system SHALL provide a logical focus order through all interactive elements.
2. WHEN focus moves between elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual focus indicators that meet contrast requirements.
3. WHEN dropdown menus or modals are opened THEN the system SHALL trap focus within the component until dismissed.
4. WHEN using arrow keys in lists or menus THEN the system SHALL support standard keyboard navigation patterns.
5. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are available THEN the system SHALL document them and ensure they don't conflict with assistive technology.

### 3. Visual Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want sufficient color contrast and scalable text, so that I can read and interact with all content comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
2. WHEN colors convey information THEN the system SHALL provide additional non-color indicators (icons, patterns, text).
3. WHEN users zoom to 200% THEN the system SHALL remain fully functional without horizontal scrolling.
4. WHEN interactive elements are hovered or focused THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback that meets contrast requirements.
5. WHEN animations are present THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion.

### 4. Mobile Accessibility

**User Story:** As a mobile user with accessibility needs, I want the same level of accessibility on mobile devices, so that I can use the platform regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper touch target sizes (minimum 44x44 pixels).
2. WHEN navigating on mobile THEN the system SHALL support swipe gestures for screen reader users.
3. WHEN forms are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate input types and autocomplete attributes.
4. WHEN orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain accessibility features in both portrait and landscape modes.
5. WHEN using voice control THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements have accessible names.

### 5. Cognitive Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with cognitive disabilities, I want clear, consistent navigation and error handling, so that I can understand and use the platform effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, specific error messages with suggestions for resolution.
2. WHEN complex processes are required THEN the system SHALL break them into manageable steps with progress indicators.
3. WHEN timeouts are necessary THEN the system SHALL warn users and provide options to extend time limits.
4. WHEN navigation patterns are established THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all pages.
5. WHEN instructions are provided THEN the system SHALL use clear, simple language and provide examples when helpful.

### 6. Assistive Technology Integration

**User Story:** As a user of assistive technologies, I want seamless integration with my tools, so that I can use the platform with my preferred accessibility software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using voice recognition software THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements have unique, descriptive names.
2. WHEN using switch navigation THEN the system SHALL support standard switch navigation patterns.
3. WHEN using magnification software THEN the system SHALL maintain layout integrity at high zoom levels.
4. WHEN using alternative input devices THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to all supported input methods.
5. WHEN assistive technology queries element properties THEN the system SHALL provide accurate role, state, and property information.

### 7. Accessibility Testing and Compliance

**User Story:** As a platform stakeholder, I want ongoing accessibility testing and compliance monitoring, so that we maintain high accessibility standards over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are developed THEN the system SHALL undergo automated accessibility testing as part of the build process.
2. WHEN accessibility issues are identified THEN the system SHALL prioritize fixes based on impact and WCAG compliance level.
3. WHEN manual testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL be tested with actual assistive technologies and users with disabilities.
4. WHEN accessibility standards are updated THEN the system SHALL be reviewed and updated to maintain compliance.
5. WHEN accessibility features are implemented THEN the system SHALL document them for users and provide usage instructions.
