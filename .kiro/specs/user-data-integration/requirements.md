# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin interface currently relies on mock data for user information, which prevents accurate user management and analytics. This feature will implement comprehensive user data integration that supports both OAuth and traditional authentication methods, enabling the admin interface to work with real user data from Firestore.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view real user data instead of mock data, so that I can make informed decisions based on actual platform usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the user management interface THEN the system SHALL display real user data from Firestore
2. WHEN user data is unavailable or loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states instead of mock data
3. IF a user has incomplete profile information THEN the system SHALL display available data and indicate missing fields
4. WHEN displaying user lists THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large user datasets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to retrieve user information for both OAuth and traditional signup users, so that I can manage all platform users regardless of their registration method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying user data THEN the system SHALL retrieve information for users who signed up via OAuth providers
2. WHEN querying user data THEN the system SHALL retrieve information for users who signed up via traditional email/password
3. WHEN a user has multiple authentication methods THEN the system SHALL consolidate their data into a single user profile
4. IF user authentication data is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL log the issue and provide fallback display information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to search and filter users by various criteria, so that I can quickly find specific users or user groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for users THEN the system SHALL support search by email, display name, and user ID
2. WHEN filtering users THEN the system SHALL support filters by registration method, account status, and creation date
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL highlight matching criteria in the results
4. IF no users match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view detailed user profiles with commitment and transaction history, so that I can understand user engagement and resolve support issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a user profile THEN the system SHALL display complete user information including authentication method
2. WHEN viewing user details THEN the system SHALL show user's commitment history with market information
3. WHEN viewing user details THEN the system SHALL display transaction history with token movements
4. WHEN user data is being loaded THEN the system SHALL show progressive loading states for different data sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform owner, I want the admin interface properly protected using the existing Firebase Auth system with admin claims, so that only authorized personnel can access sensitive user data and admin functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin routes THEN the system SHALL verify Firebase Auth tokens with admin custom claims
2. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL verify their Firebase Auth credentials and admin claim
3. WHEN admin session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to admin login page
4. IF unauthorized users attempt admin access THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect to login

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin, I want reliable API endpoints for user data retrieval, so that the admin interface can function consistently without mock data dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin interface requests user data THEN the API SHALL return real data from Firestore with proper error handling
2. WHEN user data queries fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN handling large user datasets THEN the API SHALL implement efficient pagination and caching
4. IF database connections fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and inform the admin of the issue
