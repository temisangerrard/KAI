# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI prediction platform currently uses mock data in user-facing components, preventing users from seeing their actual activity, commitments, and transaction history. Users need to see their real data when they sign in, including their token balance, prediction commitments, transaction history, and market participation. This feature will replace mock data with real database queries to provide users with accurate, personalized information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my actual token balance and transaction history, so that I can track my real financial activity on the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their wallet page THEN the system SHALL display their actual token balance from the database
2. WHEN viewing transaction history THEN the system SHALL show real transactions instead of mock data
3. WHEN a transaction occurs THEN the system SHALL immediately update the user's displayed balance
4. WHEN viewing transaction details THEN the system SHALL show accurate timestamps, amounts, and transaction types
5. IF a user has no transactions THEN the system SHALL display "No transactions yet" instead of mock data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my actual market commitments and predictions, so that I can track what I've backed and their current status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their activity THEN the system SHALL display their real prediction commitments from the database
2. WHEN viewing commitments THEN the system SHALL show actual market names, positions taken, and amounts committed
3. WHEN a commitment status changes THEN the system SHALL reflect the updated status (active, won, lost, refunded)
4. WHEN viewing prediction history THEN the system SHALL show real odds at time of commitment and potential winnings
5. IF a user has no commitments THEN the system SHALL display "No predictions yet" instead of mock data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my real participation across markets, so that I can understand my activity and performance on the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their profile or dashboard THEN the system SHALL display actual markets they've participated in
2. WHEN viewing market participation THEN the system SHALL show real commitment amounts and positions for each market
3. WHEN markets resolve THEN the system SHALL update the user's win/loss record with actual results
4. WHEN viewing performance metrics THEN the system SHALL calculate real statistics from actual user data
5. IF a user hasn't participated in markets THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates of my data, so that changes are immediately reflected when I interact with the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a commitment THEN the system SHALL immediately update their balance and commitment list
2. WHEN a user purchases tokens THEN the system SHALL instantly reflect the new balance across all components
3. WHEN markets resolve THEN the system SHALL update the user's data in real-time
4. WHEN viewing any user data THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency across all components
5. IF data fails to load THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error states instead of mock data
