# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI prediction platform's Firestore security rules are missing critical rules for the `admin_users` collection, which breaks admin authentication and user data retrieval. The `isAdmin()` helper function cannot access the `admin_users` collection to verify admin status, causing authentication failures and preventing admin users from accessing protected resources. This is a critical security and functionality issue that must be resolved immediately.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to be able to authenticate and access admin-protected resources, so that I can manage the platform effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user logs in THEN the system SHALL verify their admin status using the `admin_users` collection
2. WHEN the `isAdmin()` function is called THEN the system SHALL successfully read from the `admin_users` collection
3. WHEN admin users access admin-protected collections THEN the system SHALL grant appropriate access based on their admin status
4. WHEN non-admin users attempt to access admin-protected resources THEN the system SHALL deny access appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user (admin or regular), I want to be able to retrieve my user data from Firestore, so that the application can function properly with my profile information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL allow them to read their own user document from the `users` collection
2. WHEN the application needs user profile data THEN the system SHALL retrieve it without authentication errors
3. WHEN users update their profile information THEN the system SHALL allow them to write to their own user document
4. WHEN the hybrid CDP/Firebase authentication system is used THEN the system SHALL properly map wallet addresses to Firebase UIDs for data access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Firestore security rules that properly support the hybrid CDP/Firebase authentication system, so that both authentication methods work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CDP users authenticate THEN the system SHALL allow them to access their mapped user documents
2. WHEN Firebase users authenticate THEN the system SHALL allow them to access their user documents directly
3. WHEN the `wallet_uid_mappings` collection is accessed THEN the system SHALL allow read/write operations for authentication mapping
4. WHEN authentication context is established THEN the system SHALL properly identify user ownership for data access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure but functional Firestore rules that don't break legitimate operations, so that the platform remains both secure and operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firestore rules are deployed THEN the system SHALL maintain security while allowing legitimate operations
2. WHEN admin operations are performed THEN the system SHALL verify admin status without blocking legitimate admin access
3. WHEN user data operations are performed THEN the system SHALL allow users to access their own data while preventing unauthorized access
4. WHEN the application performs system operations THEN the system SHALL have appropriate permissions for necessary database operations
