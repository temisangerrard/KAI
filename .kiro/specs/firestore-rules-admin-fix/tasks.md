# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. URGENT: Add missing admin_users collection rules to fix cascading rule failures
  - Add proper security rules for the `admin_users` collection in firestore.rules (CRITICAL)
  - Allow users to read their own admin status: `allow read: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(userId);`
  - Allow existing admins to write/modify admin status: `allow write: if isAdmin();`
  - This fixes the `isAdmin()` function which is causing ALL rules with `|| isAdmin()` to fail
  - Test that user token balances and data become accessible again after this fix
  - Verify CDP authentication can access user data (token balance, profile, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Fix users collection rules to support proper user data access
  - Replace temporary permissive rules (`allow read, write: if true`) with proper security
  - Allow users to read and write their own user documents with `isOwner(userId)` check
  - Allow admins to access all user documents for administrative purposes
  - Support both Firebase UID and CDP wallet address authentication patterns
  - Test that users can access their profile data after login
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Ensure wallet_uid_mappings collection supports hybrid authentication
  - Review and optimize rules for the `wallet_uid_mappings` collection
  - Allow authenticated users to read mappings for authentication lookup
  - Allow users to create/update their own wallet mappings during registration
  - Allow admins to manage wallet mappings for user support
  - Test that CDP users can successfully authenticate and access their data
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Remove temporary permissive rules and implement proper security
  - Replace `allow read, write: if true` rules in markets collection with proper authentication
  - Ensure markets can be read by authenticated users and written by admins
  - Review all collections for overly permissive temporary rules
  - Implement proper security while maintaining functionality
  - Test that all legitimate operations still work with proper security rules
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Test admin authentication and access patterns
  - Test that admin users can log in and access admin-protected resources
  - Verify that the admin dashboard and admin operations work correctly
  - Test market resolution functionality with proper admin authentication
  - Ensure non-admin users are properly blocked from admin operations
  - Test both Firebase and CDP admin users if applicable
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Test user data access for both authentication methods
  - Test Firebase authenticated users can access their user documents
  - Test CDP authenticated users can access their mapped user documents
  - Verify user profile operations work correctly for both authentication types
  - Test user balance and transaction access with proper authentication
  - Ensure users cannot access other users' data inappropriately
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Validate security enforcement and error handling
  - Test that unauthorized access attempts are properly blocked
  - Verify appropriate error messages are returned for permission denied scenarios
  - Test edge cases like expired authentication tokens
  - Ensure security rules don't break legitimate application functionality
  - Test that the application handles authentication errors gracefully
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Deploy and monitor Firestore rules changes
  - Deploy the updated Firestore rules to the development environment
  - Monitor for any new permission denied errors or authentication issues
  - Test the complete application flow from login to data access
  - Verify that all existing functionality continues to work
  - Document any remaining issues that need additional fixes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
