# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI prediction platform is experiencing issues with token commitment submissions. Users are encountering "API Error: {}" when attempting to submit commitments to predictions, preventing them from participating in the prediction markets. This feature addresses the root causes of commitment submission failures and implements robust error handling and debugging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully submit token commitments to predictions, so that I can participate in prediction markets without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a valid token commitment THEN the system SHALL process the commitment successfully
2. WHEN a user submits a commitment with sufficient balance THEN the system SHALL update their balance and create the commitment record
3. WHEN a user submits a commitment to an active market THEN the system SHALL accept the commitment without errors
4. WHEN the commitment API is called with valid data THEN the system SHALL return a success response with commitment details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear error messages when my commitment fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commitment fails due to insufficient balance THEN the system SHALL display a clear insufficient balance message
2. WHEN a commitment fails due to market status THEN the system SHALL display a market status error message
3. WHEN a commitment fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a network error message
4. WHEN a commitment fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL display specific validation error messages
5. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging and debugging information, so that I can quickly identify and resolve commitment submission issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commitment API call is made THEN the system SHALL log the request details
2. WHEN a commitment fails THEN the system SHALL log the complete error stack trace
3. WHEN Firebase operations fail THEN the system SHALL log Firebase-specific error details
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log validation error details
5. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL log network error information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the commitment process to handle edge cases gracefully, so that temporary issues don't prevent me from participating in predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry the operation with exponential backoff
2. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL implement request timeouts and retries
3. WHEN concurrent users commit to the same market THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions properly
4. WHEN the user's balance is updated by another process THEN the system SHALL refresh and validate the current balance
5. WHEN the market status changes during commitment THEN the system SHALL validate the current market state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor commitment submission health, so that I can proactively address system issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commitment submissions occur THEN the system SHALL track success and failure rates
2. WHEN commitment errors exceed a threshold THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
3. WHEN Firebase operations fail THEN the system SHALL track Firebase health metrics
4. WHEN API response times are slow THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics
5. WHEN users encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide error tracking and analytics
