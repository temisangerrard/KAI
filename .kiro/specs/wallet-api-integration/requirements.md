# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI wallet dashboard currently fails in deployed environments due to "Failed to fetch" errors when trying to access external blockchain APIs (like api.basescan.org). This feature will replace external API calls with CDP's built-in APIs and implement proper error handling to ensure the wallet works reliably in all environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my wallet balance to load reliably without external API failures, so that I can always see my current token balances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet page loads THEN the system SHALL use CDP's built-in balance APIs instead of external blockchain APIs
2. WHEN external API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display graceful error messages instead of throwing unhandled exceptions
3. WHEN balance data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a loading state or cached data with appropriate indicators
4. WHEN the user refreshes balance data THEN the system SHALL retry using CDP APIs with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my transaction history to load without external API dependencies, so that I can view my recent transactions reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet loads transaction history THEN the system SHALL use CDP's transaction APIs instead of external blockchain explorers
2. WHEN transaction data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state or cached data
3. WHEN transaction fetching fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN the user refreshes transactions THEN the system SHALL retry with proper error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wallet to work offline or with limited connectivity, so that I can still access basic wallet functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL show cached data with appropriate staleness indicators
2. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout handling with user feedback
3. WHEN the wallet is offline THEN the system SHALL display offline indicators and cached data
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error boundaries and logging, so that wallet failures can be diagnosed and fixed quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN the wallet component crashes THEN the system SHALL display an error boundary instead of a blank page
3. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms for users
4. WHEN errors are not recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on next steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent loading states and feedback, so that I understand when the wallet is working on my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators for each section
2. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL disable relevant buttons and show progress
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide success feedback and update the UI
4. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL show error states with retry options
