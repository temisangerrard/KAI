# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI wallet currently uses existing CDP hooks and SDK functionality but has a basic interface that doesn't match modern wallet UI standards like MetaMask, Rabby, and Zerion. This feature will modernize the wallet UI design while preserving all existing CDP functionality including `useEvmAddress`, `useSendEvmTransaction`, `useCurrentUser`, and `useSendUserOperation` hooks. The focus is purely on visual design improvements and component restructuring without changing the underlying CDP integration.

2. WHEN the user views their ETH balance THEN the existing `useEvmAddress` and balance fetching logic SHALL be preserved but displayed in a modern card layout
3. WHEN the user sends transactions THEN the existing `useSendEvmTransaction` and `useSendUserOperation` functionality SHALL work unchanged with improved UI
