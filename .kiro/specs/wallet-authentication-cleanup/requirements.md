# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI platform currently has redundant authentication logic in the wallet page that conflicts with the main application's authentication flow. Users authenticate through the main app's auth system, but the wallet page contains its own authentication check and redirect logic that creates a confusing user experience. This feature will consolidate authentication handling and ensure the wallet page properly integrates with the existing authentication system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has already authenticated in the main KAI app, I want to access the wallet page without encountering additional authentication prompts, so that I have a seamless experience navigating between different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the wallet page AND they are already authenticated in the main app THEN the wallet page SHALL display the wallet interface without showing authentication prompts
2. WHEN a user is authenticated in the main app THEN the wallet page SHALL use the existing authentication state from the main app's auth context
3. WHEN a user accesses the wallet page THEN the page SHALL NOT redirect them to a separate authentication flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who is not authenticated, I want to be redirected to the main app's authentication flow when accessing the wallet page, so that I can authenticate once and access all features consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses the wallet page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the main app's authentication flow (not a wallet-specific auth page)
2. WHEN a user completes authentication through the main app flow THEN they SHALL be redirected back to the wallet page
3. WHEN authentication fails or is cancelled THEN the user SHALL remain in the main app's authentication flow with appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the KAI platform, I want authentication logic to be centralized and consistent across all pages, so that authentication behavior is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the wallet page code THEN there SHALL be no wallet-specific authentication components or logic
2. WHEN a user's authentication state changes THEN all pages including the wallet page SHALL reflect the updated state consistently
3. WHEN implementing new features THEN developers SHALL use the centralized authentication system without duplicating auth logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating the KAI platform, I want consistent authentication behavior across all pages, so that I understand how authentication works and don't encounter unexpected authentication prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN all protected pages including the wallet SHALL be accessible without additional authentication steps
2. WHEN a user's session expires THEN all pages including the wallet SHALL handle the unauthenticated state consistently
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the wallet page SHALL reflect the unauthenticated state and redirect appropriately using the same flow as other pages
