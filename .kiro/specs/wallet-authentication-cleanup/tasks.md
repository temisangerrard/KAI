  - Keep only the wallet functionality that should be available to authenticated users
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 2. Verify wallet page uses existing authentication system
  - Ensure wallet page relies on the existing AuthProvider for authentication state
  - Confirm that unauthenticated users are handled by the app-level authentication system

  - Verify wallet page behavior matches other protected pages in the app
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Test authentication consistency across the application
  - Test that unauthenticated users are redirected consistently from wallet page
  - Verify that authenticated users have seamless access to wallet page
  - Confirm no duplicate authentication prompts appear when navigating to wallet
  - Test session expiry handling is consistent between wallet and other pages
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Update wallet page to focus on wallet functionality only
  - Ensure wallet page only contains wallet-specific features and UI
  - Remove any authentication-related imports that are no longer needed
  - Clean up any unused authentication state or handlers
  - Verify wallet page code is focused on wallet functionality, not authentication
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
