# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will complete the existing admin market management functionality by implementing the missing edit page and delete functionality. The admin interface already has the market list, edit buttons, and authentication - we just need to build the pages these buttons link to.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to edit existing markets so that I can update basic market information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks the existing edit button THEN the system SHALL display the market edit page at `/admin/markets/[id]/edit`
2. WHEN the edit page loads THEN the system SHALL show a form with current market data (title, description, category, end date)
3. WHEN an admin submits changes THEN the system SHALL update the market in Firebase
4. WHEN changes are saved THEN the system SHALL redirect back to the market list with a success message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to delete markets so that I can remove problematic markets from the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks the existing "More" button THEN the system SHALL show a dropdown with delete option
2. WHEN an admin clicks delete THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
3. WHEN deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL remove the market from Firebase
4. WHEN a market is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the market list and show a success message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the edit and delete operations to work without Firebase errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing edit or delete operations THEN the system SHALL use the existing admin authentication pattern
2. WHEN Firebase operations are executed THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to login
