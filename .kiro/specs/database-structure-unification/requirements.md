# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAI prediction platform has critical database structure inconsistencies that prevent reliable market resolution functionality. Multiple conflicting Market interfaces, inconsistent property naming, and fragmented data transformation logic create a chaotic data layer that must be unified before market resolution can work properly. This spec addresses the foundational database structure issues to create a single source of truth for market data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, consistent Market interface across the entire codebase, so that all services and components work with the same data structure without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service imports a Market interface THEN the system SHALL use the same interface definition from a single source
2. WHEN market data is accessed THEN the system SHALL use consistent property names across all components and services
3. WHEN new market-related code is written THEN the system SHALL enforce the unified interface through TypeScript compilation
4. WHEN market data flows between services THEN the system SHALL not require property name transformations or mappings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive MarketStatus enum that covers all possible market states, so that market lifecycle management works consistently across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a market status is set THEN the system SHALL accept all valid status values from the complete enum
2. WHEN market status validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the same status enum in TypeScript interfaces, Zod schemas, and database operations
3. WHEN market resolution processes run THEN the system SHALL transition through status values that exist in the unified enum
4. WHEN status-based queries are performed THEN the system SHALL recognize all valid status values without validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unified data transformation logic in a single service layer, so that Firestore data conversion is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firestore data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL transform it through a single, centralized service
2. WHEN market data is saved to Firestore THEN the system SHALL use consistent field mapping through the unified service
3. WHEN data transformation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
4. WHEN new market fields are added THEN the system SHALL require updates only in the centralized transformation service

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing market-related services updated to use the unified interface, so that the entire codebase works with consistent data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trending service calculates scores THEN the system SHALL access market properties using the unified interface
2. WHEN market creation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the unified interface for all market operations
3. WHEN admin services manage markets THEN the system SHALL use the unified interface for all administrative operations
4. WHEN market resolution processes run THEN the system SHALL use the unified interface throughout the resolution workflow

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated user commitment tracking in the unified database structure, so that market resolution can accurately calculate payouts based on actual user positions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market participation metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL derive totalParticipants and totalTokensStaked from actual PredictionCommitment records
2. WHEN market resolution occurs THEN the system SHALL access all user commitments for the market to calculate payouts accurately
3. WHEN market data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show real-time participation data based on current commitments
4. WHEN users commit tokens to positions THEN the system SHALL update market metrics automatically through the unified data service

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation that prevents interface mismatches, so that runtime errors from property access conflicts are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL fail compilation if any service uses incorrect Market interface properties
2. WHEN Zod validation runs THEN the system SHALL accept all valid market data without enum or property validation errors
3. WHEN market data is processed THEN the system SHALL not generate console errors from property access mismatches
4. WHEN new market-related code is added THEN the system SHALL enforce interface consistency through TypeScript strict mode
