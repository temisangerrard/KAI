# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Token Management System enables users to purchase, store, and spend tokens within the KAI prediction platform. This system provides a complete token economy where users can buy tokens with real money, maintain token balances, commit tokens to predictions, and earn rewards for accurate predictions. The implementation follows a Web2 approach using traditional payment processing and database storage for simplicity and regulatory compliance.
